# Hotel-Management-System
This is the proposed system for hotel Silver Sands since currently all the employees interact with manual methods of data transmission and it has caused many issues to the organization when performing front desk operations. 
So our client wants to overcome from those problems by having a computerized system. So as a solution we have come up with this proposed system.
